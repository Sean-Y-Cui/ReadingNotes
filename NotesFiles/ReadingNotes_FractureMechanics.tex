Fracture mechanics is the mechanical analysis of materials containing one or more cracks to predict the conditions when failure is likely to occur.--by ScienceDirect Topics
\subsection{Overview}
two ways of solve FEM problems in terms of HPC:
\begin{itemize}
	\item using open-source FEM software MFEM\cite{mfem-library}, deal.ii\cite{Arndt-2007-} (with HPC functions) 
	\item using library like hypre, PETSc and build your own software
\end{itemize} \index{MFEM,deal.ii,hypre,PETSc}
\subsection{related packages/project}
\begin{itemize}
	\item FASTMath (backed by US.DOE)
\end{itemize}
